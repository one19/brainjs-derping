### TODO:
1. If we're deadset on using the browser, use it for real with an input for the tweet
2. If we're deadset on reading tweets, use the twitter api to grab the data.
3. Output the trained model into a file to be consumed by our frontend so we don't train every time.
4. Don't just console.log the results lol
5. Do proper modularization
